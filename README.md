Analyzing people movements in a building
This is a project where we analyzed people's movements inside a building based on location data.

The script checks if two userId's have met in the building.

### Usage example:
```
Rscript analyzeMeetings.R uid1 uid2
```
Or from RStudio, more documentation in the pdf file.
